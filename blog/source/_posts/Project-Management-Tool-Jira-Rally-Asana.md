# Project Management Tool (Jira, Rally, Asana)

## 1. Overview

Agile team needs to distribute tasks and quickly update progress.
During a standup meeting, every morning, you'd usually update your progress and ask for help if needed.
This agile practice can be easily achieved with project management tools.
In this post, we are going to explore `Asana` to learn more about what project management tools offer.

You can add comments and tag other people to ask helps.
Each task can have multiple sub-tasks.

You don't need this if working alone.
But, a different person can work on the task (not the person created the task).
Specify what condition should be met in order to call the task completed.
